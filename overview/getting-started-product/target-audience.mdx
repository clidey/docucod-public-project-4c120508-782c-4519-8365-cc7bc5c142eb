## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Relying solely on funding amount without considering lifespan and shutdown reasons may give an incomplete view.

## Code Example: Filtering Companies by Category and Batch
```tsx
import { useState, useMemo } from 'react';
import { useCompanyData } from '@/hooks/useCompanyData';

const useFilteredCompanies = (companies) => {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
  const [selectedCategory, setSelectedCategory] = useState('all');
  const [selectedBatch, setSelectedBatch] = useState('all');

  const { filterCompanies } = useCompanyData(companies);

  const filteredCompanies = useMemo(() => {
    return filterCompanies(searchTerm, selectedCategory, selectedBatch);
  }, [searchTerm, selectedCategory, selectedBatch, filterCompanies]);

  return {
    filteredCompanies,
    searchTerm,
    setSearchTerm,
    selectedCategory,
    setSelectedCategory,
    selectedBatch,
    setSelectedBatch
  };
};
```

This snippet exemplifies how you can filter failed companies using category and batch — essential for tailoring insights to your context.
