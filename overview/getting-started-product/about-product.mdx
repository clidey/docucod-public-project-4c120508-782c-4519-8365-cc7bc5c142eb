# What is Y Combinator Graveyard Stories?

## Discover Lessons from Startup Failures

Y Combinator Graveyard Stories is a unique, human-centered web application designed to bring to light the journeys of defunct Y Combinator startups. It offers a searchable and insightful database that catalogs companies that didn’t make it, providing founders, researchers, and enthusiasts with valuable lessons drawn from the rise and fall of these ventures.

### Why This Matters

Understanding why startups fail is just as critical as studying what makes them succeed. This application empowers you to explore real-world examples of startup challenges—from product misfit to fierce competition and market timing—helping you avoid common pitfalls and make smarter decisions in your own entrepreneurial journey.

## What Y Combinator Graveyard Stories Is

Simply put, this is a curated collection of information on Y Combinator companies that have shut down from 2005 to 2025. Each company profile includes key details such as:

- Company name and batch
- Description of the business
- Year founded and shutdown
- Category and market segment
- Funding raised
- The stated reason for failure

This data is thoughtfully organized and accessible through intuitive filters and search capabilities, enabling you to quickly surface the stories and patterns that matter most to your research or curiosity.

## Core Purpose

The primary goal of the application is to turn raw data about these failed startups into actionable insights. Whether you want to understand trends over different YC batches, explore industries with high failure rates, or analyze typical failure reasons, this tool serves as your starting point for learning and reflection.

## What Makes It Unique

- **Human-centric storytelling:** Instead of just dry data, the app emphasizes contextual reasons and descriptions — the stories behind the numbers.
- **Comprehensive timeframe:** Covers YC startups spanning two decades, showing how failure trends evolve with market changes.
- **Search & filter driven:** Flexible exploration via search terms and filters for categories and batches means you can tailor discovery to your interests.

## How It Works at a High Level

You interact primarily through a responsive web interface:

- **Search Bar:** Enter keywords related to company names, descriptions, or failure reasons.
- **Category & Batch Filters:** Narrow down companies by industry segment or YC batch years.
- **Result Listing:** View detailed cards for companies matching your criteria.
- **Summary Statistics:** Instantly see total companies, funding lost, and average years active to grasp macro insights.

This fluid exploration experience reveals patterns and lessons without requiring deep technical expertise.
