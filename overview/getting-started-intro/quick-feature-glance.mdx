## Practical User Flow

1. **Landing on the page,** you see a visual summary of failures instantly.
2. **Use the search box** to enter company names, failure reasons, or descriptions.
3. **Select filters** for category or batch to zero in on specific subsets.
4. **Browse the dynamically updated company grid** showing matching results.
5. **Examine individual company cards** for quick insight on why and when they failed.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Start broad with ‘All Categories’ and ‘All Batches’ to get an overview before narrowing down.
- Use multiple filters simultaneously to find patterns or clusters in failures.
- Leverage search for keywords related to causes or business models you want to examine.
- Notice the funding lost and lifespan metrics to contextualize failure impact over time.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Empty searches:** If no companies appear, try broadening your search terms or resetting filters.
- **Over-filtering:** Applying too many restrictive filters might return no results; adjust filters progressively.
- **Ignoring filters:** Relying on search alone may miss batch or category insights.
