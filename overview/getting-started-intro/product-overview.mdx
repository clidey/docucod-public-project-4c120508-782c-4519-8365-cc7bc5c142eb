## What is Y Combinator Graveyard Stories?

Y Combinator Graveyard Stories is a web-based platform that collects and presents detailed accounts of YC startups that have shut down. Each company's profile includes the startup's description, funding raised, active years, category, batch, and most importantly, the reason for shutdown—often with a witty, unvarnished explanation.

At its core, this app solves the problem of opaque startup failures by centralizing these stories in one accessible place. It opens a window to the realities of startup life, helping users extract actionable insights from the inevitable failures within the YC portfolio.

### What Sets It Apart?

- **Extensive Dataset:** Covers failed YC companies from 1999 through 2024, including hundreds of shutdown stories.
- **Rich, User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive filtering and search to explore companies by batch, category, funding, and reasons.
- **Humorous and Honest Data:** Provides entertaining, relatable shutdown reasons that make learning engaging.

### How It Works (User Perspective)

Users start by viewing a dynamic overview with summary metrics such as total failed companies, total funding lost, and average years active. They then filter and search through startups using categories and batch years or by keywords covering names, descriptions, or shutdown reasons. Clicking on any company reveals its detailed profile card showing its story, funding, category, and exact shutdown cause.

## Key Features & User Benefits

- **Aggregated Startup Profiles:** Quickly access over 260 YC failed startup accounts with full context on their lifecycle and funding.

- **Advanced Filtering:** Narrow down companies by industry category, batch cohort, or keyword search to focus on relevant cases.

- **Insightful Metrics Dashboard:** Visualize total companies, funding lost, and average operational lifespan to grasp scale and impact.

### Real-World Example

Imagine you're an early-stage founder in the Social Media space. By filtering failed YC startups in that category, you uncover patterns like fierce competition from giants (Facebook, Twitter), difficulty in user adoption, or the risks of copying existing ideas without differentiation. This targeted view helps you strategize smarter product-market fit and competitive positioning.
