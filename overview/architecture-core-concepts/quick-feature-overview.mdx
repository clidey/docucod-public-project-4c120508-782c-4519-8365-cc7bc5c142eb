## 1. Searchable Company Cards

At the heart of the app are individual company cards that present vital details for each failed startup. These cards are designed for quick comprehension and easy comparison.

- **Where to Find It:** Located in the main results grid on the homepage and search results pages.
- **Example:** Typing “healthcare” in the search bar filters to companies in the healthcare category, instantly narrowing your focus.

## 2. Filtering by Batch and Category

Refine your exploration by using the interactive filters for startup **Batch** (YC cohort year) and **Category** (industry or business type).

- **Responsive:** Updates results instantly as you type, delivering a seamless experience.
- **Where to Find It:** Search input is integrated in the filters section at the page top.

## 4. Summary Dashboards

- **Benefit:** Quickly grasp the overall scope and impact of YC startups that didn’t succeed.
- **Where to Find It:** The hero banner near the top of the homepage offers these key stats.

## 5. Responsive Grid Layout

The dynamic, responsive grid presents company cards efficiently across all device sizes.

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of These Features

- Use combined filters + search terms to narrow results precisely.
- Don’t ignore the summary dashboards; they provide critical context.
- Adjust your batch or category selections progressively to spot trends over time or across sectors.
- For mobile users, the responsive grid and filters maintain full functionality—explore confidently from any device.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Over-filtering:** Selecting very narrow filters can return zero results. If this happens, try broadening your search or removing one filter.
- **Keyword Misalignment:** Searching only by keyword without using filters might overlook grouped context. Combine filters with keywords for best results.
- **Ignoring Dashboard Stats:** Missing the summary metrics means losing the big-picture view. Always glance at these stats to frame your analysis.
