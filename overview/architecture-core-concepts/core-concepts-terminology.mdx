# Core Concepts & Terminology

Welcome to the foundational glossary of Y Combinator Graveyard Stories. This page breaks down the essential terms and concepts you’ll encounter across the app, ensuring we share a common language. Whether you’re browsing failed startups or analyzing dataset insights, understanding these key ideas will make your experience seamless and insightful.

## What Is a "Dead Company"?

In Y Combinator Graveyard Stories, a **dead company** refers to any startup that has officially shut down after participating in a Y Combinator batch. This collection represents the end of a company’s journey in terms of operations, funding, and market presence.

### Why Focus on Dead Companies?
The purpose is to **learn from failure** — by understanding why these startups didn't survive, founders, investors, and researchers gain critical insights to increase the odds of success in future ventures.

### Attributes of a Dead Company in the Dataset
Each dead company is characterized by these core data points:

- **Name:** The startup’s official name.
- **Batch:** The Y Combinator batch they participated in (e.g., `W20`, `S21`).
- **Year Founded and Shutdown:** Dates marking the startup’s operational lifespan.
- **Category:** Industry or sector (e.g., `FinTech`, `AI`, `Gaming`).
- **Funding:** Total raised capital before shutdown.
- **Description:** Brief overview of their product or mission.
- **Reason for Shutdown:** The key cause behind the company’s failure, often summarizing market or strategic challenges.

Understanding these attributes helps you filter and analyze companies with precision.

## Understanding "Batches" and Their Importance

The **batch** indicates the cohort during which the company entered Y Combinator. YC operates twice a year, typically labeled by:

- **W (Winter)** batch (e.g., `W24` for Winter 2024)
- **S (Summer)** batch (e.g., `S23` for Summer 2023)

### Why Batches Matter
Batches group startups by timeframe, helping contextualize:

- Economic cycles affecting startups
- Shifts in technology trends
- The evolving YC environment

For example, startups in batch `W20` faced very different challenges than those in `S24` due to the pandemic’s impact and emerging tech.

## Categories: Navigating Industry Segments

Each startup is assigned a **category** representing its market sector. Categories help you:

- Narrow your exploration to industries of interest
- Compare failure trends across sectors
- Identify systemic challenges in specific domains

Common categories include but are not limited to:

- AI
- Social Media
- FinTech
- Healthcare
- Gaming
- E-commerce

By filtering companies by category, you can focus on stories most relevant to your research or investment thesis.

## Key UI Elements and Their Role in Your Workflow

To maximize your experience, it’s vital to understand the main user interface components:

### Filters Section
Allows you to tailor the data you see based on:

- **Search Term:** Find companies using keywords in name, description, or shutdown reason.
- **Category Selector:** Choose one sector or view all.
- **Batch Selector:** Filter by YC batch to focus on specific cohorts.

This responsive filtering helps you drill down quickly and uncover meaningful insights.

### Company Grid
Displays filtered companies in a dynamic grid layout. Each company card provides a snapshot:

- Name and batch prominently shown
- Description and funding details
- Shutdown reason summarized

If your filter finds no companies, the grid clearly states no matches, helping you adjust quickly.

### Hero Section
A high-level overview panel summarizing:

- Total failed companies in dataset
- Collective funding lost
- Average years active

This snapshot anchors your exploration in context, highlighting the scope and scale of the data.

## Common Terminology Quick Reference

| Term               | Definition                                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dead Company       | A startup that has shut down after participating in a Y Combinator batch.                  |
| Batch              | A specific cohort and timeframe of startups funded by Y Combinator (e.g., `W23`, `S20`).   |
| Category           | The industry or market sector the startup belongs to.                                     |

## Practical Example: How These Concepts Flow Together

Imagine you want to research failed startups in the **AI** category from the **Winter 2023 (W23)** batch:

1. Use the **Filters Section**:
   - Set **Category** filter to `AI`.
   - Set **Batch** filter to `W23`.
   - Optionally, enter search terms like "chatbot" or "assistant".

2. View the resulting **Company Grid**, where you’ll see AI startups from W23, including their funding and shutdown reasons.

3. Use the **Hero Section** to grasp how large this subset is relative to the full dataset.

This flow lets you **quickly focus your analysis** on startups matching your research criteria.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Use broad filters first.** Start with ‘all’ in batches and categories to get a sense of the data before narrowing down.
- **Leverage search wisely.** Search terms are matched across company names, descriptions, and shutdown reasons to maximize hit rates.
- **Understand batch context.** Differences in economic and tech landscapes across batches may explain failure reasons.
- **Pay attention to funding.** High funding doesn’t guarantee success; the reasons field reveals strategic insights.

## Troubleshooting Common Pain Points

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="No Companies Found with Filters">
Make sure your search terms are spelled correctly and avoid overly narrow category and batch combinations. Try resetting filters to ‘all’ and broaden your search.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Confused About Batch Naming">
Remember, ‘W’ means Winter batch and ‘S’ means Summer batch, followed by the year (e.g., ‘S20’ is Summer 2020).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Seeing Unexpected Company Data">
The dataset aggregates data collected from public sources. Some data may be approximate or contain humorous summaries—use discretion when interpreting.
