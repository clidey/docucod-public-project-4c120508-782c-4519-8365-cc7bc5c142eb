# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the core terms behind the Y Combinator Graveyard Stories application empowers you to navigate the interface smoothly and interpret the data with confidence. This page explains essential domain concepts such as Dead Company, Batch, Category, Funding, Shutdown Reason, Filters, and Search—providing clarity on what you see and how to use it effectively.

## What You Will Learn Here

- What defines a **Dead Company** within the context of this resource
- The meaning of **Batch** and why it matters
- How **Category** groups startups for insightful analysis
- Understanding **Funding** figures and their impact
- What counts as a **Shutdown Reason** and how to interpret it
- How to leverage **Filters** and **Search** to find exactly what you need

## Dead Company

A 'Dead Company' refers to a startup that participated in the Y Combinator program but ultimately failed or shut down. This application catalogues thousands of such companies, tracking their stories, from founding to shutdown.

Each Dead Company entry includes:

- **Name**: The startup's official name
- **Batch**: The YC batch in which the company participated (e.g., S20, W21)
- **Year Founded** and **Shutdown Year**: The lifespan timeline
- **Description**: A brief summary of what the company did
- **Funding**: Total investment raised before shutdown
- **Category**: Industry or startup sector
- **Shutdown Reason**: The documented cause for failure

By exploring these details, users gain invaluable lessons on startup challenges and failure patterns.

---

## Batch

A **Batch** refers to the cohort of startups funded and supported by Y Combinator during a specific season and year. Each batch is denoted by a two-letter and two-digit code:

- **S** stands for Summer (e.g., S20 = Summer 2020)
- **W** stands for Winter (e.g., W19 = Winter 2019)

Why it matters:

- Batches indicate contemporaneous market conditions and startup trends.
- Comparing batches can reveal how startup success and failure drivers shift over time.

Use batches as a filter to focus your analysis on startups launched during particular time frames.

---

## Category

**Category** groups startups based on their primary business focus or industry segment. Examples include:

- Social Media
- FinTech
- Hardware
- AI
- E-commerce

Why categories are useful:

- They let you explore failure trends within specific sectors.
- You can benchmark startup lifespan and funding across categories.
- They help drill down from broad failure data to pinpoint industry lessons.

When using the application’s filters, selecting a category narrows down your search to relevant startups.

---

## Funding

**Funding** denotes the total capital raised by a startup before failure. It's expressed in USD and often scaled in millions (M) or billions (B), e.g., "$1750M" for Quibi.

Why this is important:

- Shows the financial scale and investor confidence before shutdown
- Helps correlate funding amount with startup lifespan and failure causes

Note: Funding values are approximate and sourced from available public data.

---

## Shutdown Reason

The **Shutdown Reason** captures the primary cause or context behind a startup’s failure. These reasons range from market shifts to technology challenges or business model flaws.

Examples include:

- "Turned out nobody wanted to watch TV shows in 10-minute chunks"
- "COVID ended and people remembered they hated talking to strangers"
- "Google killed it like they kill everything else"

How to use shutdown reasons:

- Gain qualitative insights beyond just numbers
- Discover recurring themes or surprising failure triggers
- Inform your own decisions by learning what *not* to do

---

## Filters

Filters enable targeted exploration. You can refine the list of startups displayed by:

- **Search Term**: Text search across company names, descriptions, and shutdown reasons
- **Category**: Choose an industry segment to focus on
- **Batch**: Select a particular YC batch or range of batches

This combination allows you to: 

- Quickly pinpoint startups matching your research interest
- Compare results across different segments or time frames
- Detect nuanced trends in failed startups

### Best Practices

- Start broad and narrow down filters progressively to avoid empty results
- Use keywords thoughtfully—try both company names and broad terms
- Combine category and batch filters for precise snapshots of failure data

---

## Search

The search function is your tool for discovering specific companies or themes. It works by searching through:

- Company names
- Descriptions
- Shutdown reasons

Examples:

- Searching "AI" shows all startups involved with artificial intelligence that failed
- Searching "COVID" highlights companies affected by the pandemic

### Tips for Effective Searching

- Use simple, common keywords for best matches
- If zero results, try related terms or broader categories
- Combine search with filters to hone in on exact interests

---

## Example User Flow

Imagine you want to analyze how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted companies in the Social Media sector:

1. Enter "COVID" in the search field to capture shutdown reasons mentioning the pandemic.
2. Select "Social Media" in the category filter.
3. Choose batches around 2020 (e.g., S20, W20).
4. Review the filtered list to see how many companies shut down and their reasons.

This targeted approach reveals insights on pandemic effects within a defined business category.
