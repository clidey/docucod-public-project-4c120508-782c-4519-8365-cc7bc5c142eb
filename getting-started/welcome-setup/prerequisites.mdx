# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before you start setting up Y Combinator Graveyard Stories, ensure your environment meets the following specifications and you have the necessary tools installed. This checklist guarantees a smooth installation and optimal user experience.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms

- **Operating Systems:**
  - Windows 10 or later
  - macOS Catalina 10.15 or later
  - Linux distributions (Ubuntu 20.04+, Fedora 34+, or equivalent)

> The application relies on Node.js and modern web technologies which are fully supported on these platforms.

## 2. Required Tools & Dependencies

To install and run the application locally, you need the following:

### Node.js
- **Version:** 18.x or later (including latest LTS)
- **Reason:** Required for running the server, build tools, and package management.
- **Installation:** Download from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### npm (Node Package Manager)
- Comes bundled with Node.js.
- **Version:** 8.x or later is recommended.

### Recommended Code Editor
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):**
  - Provides excellent TypeScript and React support.
  - Extensions Recommended:
    - ESLint (helps keep your code quality high)
    - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense (for styling productivity)
    - Prettier (for code formatting consistency)
- **Download:** [VS Code Official Site](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Git
- Required for cloning the repository and version control.
- **Installation:** [Git Official Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

---

## 3. Network Requirements

- Internet access to download dependencies and libraries during installation.
- Connectivity to GitHub for cloning the repo and fetching updates.

> No special firewall configuration is typically needed.

---

## 4. Additional Environment Notes

- **Environment Variables:** No specific environment variables are required for initial setup.
- **Ports:** The web application will use default web ports (usually 3000) when running locally. Ensure these ports are not blocked or in use.
- **Permissions:** You should have local administrative privileges to install software and run commands.

## 5. Verifying Your Environment

Before proceeding, check your versions to confirm compatibility:

```bash
node -v
# Expected output: v18.x.x or higher

npm -v
# Expected output: 8.x or higher

git --version
# Should return git version string
```

If versions are below requirements, update Node.js and npm accordingly.
