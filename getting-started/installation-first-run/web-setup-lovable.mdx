# Using the Lovable Web Interface

Welcome to Lovable's browser-based environment for running Y Combinator Graveyard Stories instantly—no installation, no configuration, no local development setup required. This page guides you through beginning immediately by prompting and editing within Lovable's web interface, where changes are tracked and committed automatically. It is ideal for non-developers, rapid iteration, or anyone seeking a frictionless start.

---

## 1. Accessing Lovable’s Web Interface

Lovable offers a fully browser-hosted version of the Y Combinator Graveyard Stories project. This means you can start exploring and editing the app immediately from any modern web browser without installing dependencies, cloning repositories, or running commands.

### How to Get Started:

1. Navigate to the Lovable project's web interface URL provided by your team or Lovable platform.
2. Open the Y Combinator Graveyard Stories app directly inside the browser.

<Tip>
No local setup or development environment is needed. You just need internet access and a supported standard web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
</Tip>

## 2. Exploring and Prompting the Application

Once inside Lovable’s environment, you interact with the app in two primary ways:

- **Prompting**: Use Lovable’s input field to prompt the app to perform actions, filter data, or adjust views.
- **Editing & Iteration**: Make live changes to text, filters, or content directly in the UI, with the system automatically committing every update.

### Steps to Run Your First Operation:

1. Open the app homepage.
2. Use the search bar or filters to narrow down startup data (for example, search by category or funding batch).
3. Observe the filtered list reflecting your input immediately.
4. Modify filters or add search terms to explore different data slices effortlessly.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Search Input">
Use the search bar at the top of the filter section to enter your query or keyword, e.g., 'fintech'.
</Step>
<Step title="Select a Category">
Choose a category dropdown to further narrow companies by industry sectors, such as 'Software' or 'Hardware'.
</Step>
<Step title="Pick a Funding Batch">
Select a specific YC batch or keep it on 'All' to filter companies by startup cohorts.
</Step>
<Step title="View Results">
The company grid below updates instantly to show matching results including company names, brief data points, and shutdown information.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Each filter and search input edits the live app state, automatically committing changes so you don’t need to manually save or reload.
</Note>

## 3. Editing Content and Prompting Changes

Lovable’s environment supports editing without local IDEs or manual Git operations. When you want to change content or workflow logic:

- Select editable text or UI elements.
- Make your changes inline.
- Confirm your edits if prompted.
- Changes are version-controlled in the background automatically.

This powerful approach enables rapid iteration and experimentation, especially suited for users less familiar with code or those prioritizing speed.

### Example: Changing a Search Term

1. Click on the search input box.
2. Replace or add keywords.
3. Press Enter or click away.
4. See the filtered company list update instantly reflecting your change.

<Tip>
All edits and prompts update state live and create a history of commits behind the scenes. You can safely experiment knowing your changes are saved and reversible via the Lovable interface.
</Tip>

## 4. Understanding Outcome and Success Criteria

Your first operation is successful when:

- The application’s data grid refreshes to reflect your filter or search input immediately.
- Edits you make to inputs or filter options auto-save without error or page reload.
- No additional configuration or installing tools was necessary.

You should now be able to browse through startup shutdowns data filtered to your terms, without any setup delays.

## 5. Tips for Effective Use

- Use the search and filters to quickly find startups by keyword, batch year, or category.
- Familiarize yourself with the UI elements: Hero section presents summary stats, the filter section manipulates the data set.
- Note that every change you make is immediately committed; this supports collaborative review and rollback if integrated.
- Use the browser’s refresh if you want to reset to the original state from the last commit.
