# Quick Validation & Troubleshooting Guide

Ensure your setup of **Y Combinator Graveyard Stories** is functioning correctly by following this guide. Learn how to confirm the app runs, observe live reload behavior, identify success signals, and troubleshoot common issues.

---

## 1. Confirming the Setup is Working

### 1.1 Access the Preview in Your Browser

- After starting the project through your chosen method (e.g., local installation with your IDE or using the Lovable web interface), open your browser.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` or the URL provided by your environment.
- You should see the app’s homepage showing the YC Dead Pool dashboard:
  - Total number of failed companies
  - Total funding lost
  - Average years companies were active

If you reach this page, the web server is running and serving the frontend UI successfully.

### 1.2 Observe Automatic Reloads

- Change any source code file (for example, update filter options or the homepage text).
- Save the file.
- The preview in the browser should automatically reload to reflect your changes within 1-3 seconds.

This live reload feature confirms your development environment is watching files properly and the build system is responding to code changes.

### 1.3 Look for Success Messages in Console

- Check your terminal where you ran the start or build command.
- You should see messages like:
  ```
  vite vX.X.X dev server running at:
  > Local: http://localhost:3000/
  ```
- In the browser console, absence of errors and presence of UI components (filters, company grid) indicates success.

## 2. Common Setup Issues and How to Troubleshoot

### 2.1 The App Does Not Load or Browser Shows Blank Page

- **Verify the server is running:**
  - Ensure you executed the start command correctly:
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```
- **Check for errors in terminal:** Any build errors will prevent startup.
- **Inspect browser console:** Look for runtime JavaScript errors.
- **Ensure correct URL:** Confirm you open `http://localhost:3000` or your environment’s specified address.

### 2.2 Changes Do Not Reflect in Browser

- **Check if live reload is enabled:**
  - If using local install, verify the development server didn’t crash.
- **Try manual refresh:** Press Ctrl+R or Cmd+R.
- **Confirm file saving:** Some editors delay saves; verify files are fully saved.

### 2.3 Errors Related to Missing Modules or Commands

- Run:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Verify your Node.js version is v18 or higher.
- Confirm you have `npm` and `Git` installed.

### 2.4 Sidebar or UI Does Not Display Correctly

- The sidebar uses keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl + B) and adapts to mobile view.
- Try toggling the sidebar using these shortcuts if it’s hidden.
- Check viewport widths or browser zooms that may affect layout.

## 3. Step-by-Step Setup Validation Example (Local Installation)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Start your development server">
    Open your terminal and from your project root run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Wait until you see a message indicating the dev server is running.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2: Open the app in a browser">
    Navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```
    Confirm the YC Dead Pool landing page renders.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 3: Test live reload">
    Edit a file, e.g., `src/components/HeroSection.tsx`.
    Change some text or color, save it, and watch the browser automatically reload.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 4: Check for runtime errors">
    Open developer tools in the browser (F12 or Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+I).
    Confirm no errors exist under the console tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 5: Use sidebar toggle">
    Try Cmd/Ctrl + B to show/hide the sidebar to verify keyboard shortcut functionality.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Troubleshooting Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues & Fixes">
<Accordion title="Server Fails to Start - Port in Use">
If the dev server reports "port 3000 is already in use":

- Close other running servers on port 3000.
- Or run dev server on different port:
  ```bash
  npm run dev -- --port=3001
  ```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing npm or Node.js">
- Ensure Node.js v18+ is installed:
  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```
- Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ if missing.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Hot Reload Not Working">
- Confirm you are running in development mode (`npm run dev`).
- Restart dev server if reload stops working.
- Disable browser caching or open in incognito mode.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Sidebar Keyboard Shortcut Not Working">
- Verify focus is on the web page.
- Check browser extensions that may conflict with shortcuts.
- Try restarting browser.
