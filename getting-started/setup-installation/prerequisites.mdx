# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Ensure you have the right environment and tools configured before proceeding with the installation and usage of **Y Combinator Graveyard Stories**. This page guides you through all necessary prerequisites including supported platforms, required software versions, and system specifications.

---

## 1. Supported Environments

The application is a modern React-based web app built with Vite and TypeScript, optimized for developer productivity and performance.

- **Operating Systems:**
  - Windows 10 or later
  - macOS 10.15 Catalina or later
  - Popular Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.)

- **Node.js Environment:**
  - Node.js version 18.x or higher is required.
  - npm (Node Package Manager) bundled with Node.js is used to manage dependencies.

<Tip>
Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. You can verify your Node.js and npm versions by running:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
The output should indicate Node.js >=18.0.0 and a recent npm version.
</Tip>

## 2. Software Prerequisites

The project relies on several key tools and frameworks:

- **Node.js & npm**: Runtime and package manager for managing dependencies
- **Vite**: Modern frontend build tool — will come with the project setup
- **TypeScript**: Strictly typed JavaScript variant used in the codebase
- **React 18+**: UI framework for the app
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework managing styling

These are automatically installed or managed via the project’s `package.json`. No additional global packages are required.

## 3. System Requirements

To ensure smooth performance during development and testing, your system should meet these minimum specifications:

| Component         | Minimum Requirement            |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| CPU               | 2 GHz dual-core or better      |
| RAM               | 4 GB minimum (8 GB recommended)|
| Disk Space        | At least 500 MB free space     |
| Network           | Internet connection for package downloads and updates

<Note>
Though these are development-time requirements, running the built app in a production environment will only require a modern browser supporting ES2020 and React 18 features.
</Note>

## 4. Access Requirements

- **GitHub repository access** (if cloning the source code)
- **Basic command line proficiency** for setup and running local servers

## 5. TypeScript Compiler Options

The project uses a `tsconfig.app.json` optimized for React and modern JavaScript features:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "strict": false,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

This ensures modern syntax compatibility and smooth integration with the Vite bundler.

## 6. Recommended Tools

To enhance your experience setting up and developing with the application, consider using:

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** - with extensions for TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS
- **Git** - for cloning and source control
- **Recent web browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) for testing the app UI

## 7. Environment Setup Verification

After installing Node.js and cloning the repository:

1. Run `npm install` in the project root to install all dependencies.
2. Verify the installation by running `npm run dev` to start the development server on `http://localhost:8080`.
3. Open this URL in your browser and check the homepage loads without error.

<Check>
If you see the filtered companies grid and the dashboard statistics on the homepage, your environment is correctly set up.
</Check>

## 8. Common Pitfalls & Tips

- Ensure Node.js version is compatible; older versions may cause build failures.
- If `npm install` fails, try clearing npm cache or deleting `node_modules` and reinstalling.
- Confirm your internet connection during dependency installation.
- Use the sidebar toggle shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> to show/hide sidebar navigation (as implemented in the UI components).

## 9. Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Prerequisite Issues">
<Accordion title="Node.js Not Found or Wrong Version">
- Run `node -v` and ensure version is 18 or above.
- If not, download and install the correct version from the official Node.js website.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="npm install Fails">
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- Delete `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` or `bun.lockb` then re-run `npm install`.
- Check for network or proxy issues interrupting package downloads.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Development Server Does Not Start">
- Ensure no other service is running on port 8080.
- Check terminal logs for error messages.
- Verify `vite.config.ts` has `port: 8080` configured correctly.
