# Using UI Features Efficiently

Enhance your experience with Y Combinator Graveyard Stories by mastering the interactive UI features designed to make data exploration intuitive and insightful. This guide offers a concise walkthrough of key UI components—including badges, tooltips, and toast notifications—that empower you to navigate complex information smoothly and effectively.

## 1. Understanding the Company Cards

The Company Card is your primary touchpoint with individual startup data in the YC Graveyard Stories app. Each card distills the vital information about a failed company into a clear, digestible format.

### Key Elements on a Company Card

- **Company Name & Batch Badge**
  - The company name is prominently displayed.
  - The batch badge (e.g., 'W21') appears in the top-right corner to quickly identify when the company participated in Y Combinator.

- **Description**
  - A brief overview or tagline of the company’s business.

- **Category & Timeline**
  - The company’s industry sector (e.g., SaaS, Marketplace).
  - Founded year to shutdown year span, including total funding raised.

- **Shutdown Reason**
  - A concise statement explaining why the company ultimately failed.

### Practical Tips

- Hover over cards (where supported) to see additional details or highlights.
- Use badges as quick visual indicators to filter or scan companies by batch.

<Note>
Company Cards use consistent styling to highlight important data while maintaining readability and ease of comparison.
</Note>

## 2. Leveraging Badges

Badges are small UI elements that encapsulate status or category information instantly.

### How to Use Batch Badges Effectively

- Look for the batch badge on each company card to link companies to specific YC batches.
- Use badges as visual anchors when scanning through grids—batch badges help you group companies chronologically.
- Badge colors and variants distinguish their purpose. For example, the "destructive" variant in red marks batches for quick attention.

<Info>
Batch badges aren’t just decorative — they’re critical for filtering and identifying trends across YC cohorts.

## 3. Navigating with the Hover Card (Tooltip-like Popovers)

Hover Cards enhance your understanding by providing contextual information instantly on mouse hover or keyboard focus.

### How to Use Hover Cards

- Hover over interface elements, terms, or company names where tooltips are enabled to reveal extra explanations or metadata.
- Hover Cards relieve clutter by hiding less-critical info until you need it.
- They provide a smooth, non-intrusive way to support learning as you explore.

<Warning>
Hover Cards require cursor interaction and may not function on all mobile devices. Use alternate navigation or tap if applicable.
</Warning>

<Code>
// Usage example in code
<HoverCard>
  <HoverCardTrigger>Company Name</HoverCardTrigger>
  <HoverCardContent>Detailed company info or explanation here</HoverCardContent>
</HoverCard>
</Code>

## 4. Receiving Feedback via Toast Notifications

Toast notifications keep you informed of system messages without disrupting your flow.

### Common Uses of Toasts

- Confirmations when applying or clearing filters.
- Alerting you to system errors or important updates.
- Notifications for actions like searches that yield no results.

### How Toasts Work

- Toasts appear briefly on screen, often top-right or bottom-right.
- They automatically disappear after a delay but can be manually dismissed.
- Only one toast is visible at a time to reduce noise.

### Best Practices

- Pay attention to toast messages — they often guide next steps.
- If you miss a toast, try reproducing the action to trigger it again.

<Tip>
Toast notifications enhance awareness. Don't ignore them, especially when troubleshooting filtering or search issues.
</Tip>

## 5. Efficient Use of Filters and Search Inputs

Though this guide focuses on UI features, it’s critical to combine them effectively with filters and search inputs:

- Use search boxes to quickly locate companies by name or keywords.
- Combine category and batch filters with badges and cards to narrow results with precision.
- Toast notifications will alert you if no results match your criteria.

Refine your queries using badges as visual guides to filter by YC batch, and verify filtered results through company cards.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common UI Issues

- **No Cards Displayed After Filtering**

  - Toast notifications will usually confirm no results found.

- **Hover Cards Not Showing**
  - Ensure your cursor is correctly positioned and that JavaScript is enabled.
  - Hover Cards may not display on touch-only devices.
