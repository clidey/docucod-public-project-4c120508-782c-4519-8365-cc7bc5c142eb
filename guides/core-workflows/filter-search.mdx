## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Using the Search Bar">
    The search input allows you to look for companies by name, description, or reason for shutdown.
- Click inside the search box labeled 'Search companies, reasons, or descriptions...'
- Type keywords related to what you're looking for. For example, enter "music" to find companies involved with music.
- The app filters results in real-time, showing companies matching your search term.

*Expected Result:* The company grid updates dynamically, displaying companies whose names, descriptions, or reasons contain your search keywords.

*Tip:* Use lowercase or uppercase—it’s case-insensitive.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Filtering by Category">
    Narrow down companies by their sector or type.
- Locate the 'Category' dropdown next to the search bar.
- Click to open the list of available categories.
- Select a specific category to view companies only in that sector (e.g., 'Software', 'Entertainment').
- Choosing 'All Categories' clears the category filter.

*Expected Result:* The list updates to show only companies in the selected category.

*Tip:* You can use category filtering combined with a search term for more precise results.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Filtering by Batch">
    Focus your browsing on companies from a particular YC batch.
- Find the 'Batch' dropdown next to the 'Category' selector.
- Click to reveal all batch options such as ‘S05’, ‘S06’, etc., including ‘All Batches’.
- Select a batch to see companies from that specific cohort.

*Expected Result:* The display updates to show companies matching the selected batch.

*Tip:* Batch filters help track trends or failure patterns over specific YC years.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Combining Filters for Targeted Discovery">
    Use search, category, and batch filters together for granular navigation.
- Enter relevant keywords in the search bar.
- Select a category from the category dropdown.
- Select a batch from the batch dropdown.

*Expected Result:* The company list dynamically shows companies satisfying all three criteria.

*Verification:* The text below the filters confirms how many companies are currently shown out of the total.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understanding Filter Feedback">
    Pay attention to the summary line below filters.
- It shows "Showing X of Y companies", where X is the filtered count and Y total in the database.

*Tip:* If no results appear, try broadening your filters or clearing the search term.
  </Step>
</Steps>
